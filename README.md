# BreedLLM_manuscript
This repo implements "BreedLLM" proofs-of-concept.  Script_1: PanGenomic-LM: encodes genomes as text, generates embeddings, scores queries, integrates RAG, and provides outputs. Script_2: LangChain integrates R-based BLUP analysis: executes blup_analysis.R via an agent. Requires LLM credentials or local instance.
